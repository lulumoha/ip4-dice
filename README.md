End Goal

Be the first player to reach 100 points and win.

Game Begins

On a turn, a player rolls the die repeatedly until either:

A 1 is rolled
The player chooses to hold (stop rolling)
If a 1 is rolled, that player's turn ends and no points are earned.

If the player chooses to hold, all of the points rolled during that turn are added to his or her score.

Scoring Examples

Example 1: Player 1 rolls a 5 and decides to continue. He/she then chooses to roll seven more times (6, 4, 3, 4, 2, 5, 1). Because she rolled a 1, player 1's turn ends and he/she earns 0 points.

Example 2: Player 2 rolls a 6 and decides to continue. He/she then chooses to roll four more times (5, 3, 4, 2) and decides to hold. Player 2 earns 20 points for this turn (6+5+3+4+2=20).
